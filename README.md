# Reversi-with-Minimax

### Minimax with alpha beta pruning  
The scoring of each state is difficult, but I think that the main searching algorithm is not bad.  

Use only Minimax is not powerful enough I think.  

### MCTS and UCT  
I try to implement MCTS for searching, there might have some bug(?) need to be fixed up?  

But I think it's a little powerful than Minimax.  

How to decide the parameter C in UCT algorithm?  

Next I'll try to combine these two searching stategy.

We can test it by playing with website(?) reversi game.
